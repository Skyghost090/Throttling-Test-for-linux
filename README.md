## Overview

**Throttling-Test-for-Linux** is a tool designed to monitor and stress-test the thermal performance of CPUs, GPUs, and other critical components on Linux-based systems. It provides a comprehensive suite of tools to detect, log, and analyze thermal throttling events, helping users understand how their systems handle high-temperature conditions. This application is ideal for users who want to ensure the stability and longevity of their hardware under stress.

## Use Cases

- **Gamers**: Ensure that gaming systems maintain high performance during extended gaming sessions by monitoring thermal behavior and avoiding throttling.
- **Overclockers**: Track the impact of overclocking on thermal performance to prevent overheating and hardware damage.
- **IT Professionals**: Diagnose and troubleshoot thermal issues in enterprise environments to maintain system stability and performance.
- **Developers**: Test how your software applications impact system temperatures and optimize your code to improve thermal management.

## Features

- Monitors real-time temperature data for CPU, GPU, and other critical components.
- Detects and logs thermal throttling events across different hardware components.
- Provides insights into how high-temperature conditions affect system performance.
- Easy-to-read logs for troubleshooting and optimization.
- Lightweight and efficient, with minimal resource usage.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- A Linux-based operating system (e.g., Ubuntu, Fedora, etc.).
- Root or sudo access for installing required packages and accessing hardware sensors.
- `make` and `bash` for building and running the application.

### Steps to Install

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/throttling-test-for-linux.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd throttling-test-for-linux
   ```

3. Build the application using `make`:

   ```bash
   make
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is built, you can run it by executing the provided script.

1. Run the script `ttl.sh` to start the monitoring and stress-test:

   ```bash
   ./ttl.sh
   ```

2. The script will begin logging thermal performance and any throttling events detected on the system.

3. Use the output logs to analyze the impact of thermal conditions on your systemâ€™s performance.

4. For more advanced options or configurations, refer to the documentation or script comments.
